Trying not to feel guilty for not taking a note every day. This is for me. Ok. Breathe. Personal life been kinda hectic. Realness. 

Ok. It's 2:38am here gonna sleep and record on the flip side

Woke up at 8:23am. Note to self. No more energy drinks before bed

Gray sky today. This note is more freeform. I love the freedom of markdown

My friend had chemo yesterday. Thinking about them. 

I discovered I put more private note date in agora on accident. Maybe I should just use a separate system all together for that so there's no fear of cross contamination

Gitjournal doesn't make it easy to enter wikilinks. The search continues. Although I will say that it does integrate with git rather nicely
