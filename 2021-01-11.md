I really like the formatting changes flancian has done

experimenting with working directly out of public repo rather than scrubbing private notes each time. oI don't really even use private notes since I started [[tending the garden]] more.

Making a link to [[republic services]] while I'm thinking about it

Glad to have [[obsidian]] to manage notes

Can't believe that I didn't create node for [[digital-garden]] until today

Reading about [[the expanding circle]]

More internal reflection on the [[emotional narrative]]

Debating adding [[interesting sites]]
