I really like the formatting changes flancian has done

experimenting with working directly out of public repo rather than scrubbing private notes each time. I don't really even use private notes since I started [[tending the garden]] more.

Making a link to [[republic services]] while I'm thinking about it

Glad to have [[obsidian]] to manage notes

I keep accidentally closing a tab instead of clicking on it. Seems like a design [[anti-pattern]] 

I've been [[refactoring notes]] by looking for long bulleted lists and moving the list into a proper top level note
