- in the [[agora]] we actions that trigger certain internal actions
- list of common actions
	- [[go]]
	- [[pull]]
	- [[push]]
- I'm tempted to create a different action format because:
	- action links (most notably [[go]] links) mess with my graph view in obsidian
	- they aren't [[wikilinks]] they are categorcially different things
	- pitfalls of changing
		- requires restructuring current code
		- people are already using the current fomat
- proposed alternatives

	- action:go
