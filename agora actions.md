- in the [[agora]] we actions that trigger certain internal actions
- list of common actions
	- action:go
	- action:pulll
	- action:push
- I'm tempted to create a different action format because:
	- action links (most notably action:go links) mess with my graph view in obsidian
	- they aren't [[wikilinks]] they are categorcially different things
	- pitfalls of changing
		- requires restructuring current code
		- people are already using the current fomat
- proposed alternatives
	- action:{{action name}}
	- tag format e.g. #go #push 
		- I'm actually starting to like this version better
