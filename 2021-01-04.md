-	TIL you can use dashes for bullets, I've been using asterisks.
-	Pushed the agora browser extension to public repo
	-	https://gitlab.com/veracantcode/agora-ext
-	Tempted to move my private notes into another system, I'm kinda tired of managing two repos. Maybe obsidian can do that bit for me
	-	GitJournal only allows me one repo turns out
-	Thinking about if I want to start using a feed reader or if fedi is enough
-	TIL **Â¤** is unicode for "generic currency symbol" 

* Woke up later than I was meaning to.
* I wish there was a better [[roam-like]] for mobile. I'm using [[GitJournal]] and it's a little too limited.
	* [[todo]] look for alternatives again
* My msg on [[fedi]] got a bunch of likes
	* https://freethinkers.lgbt/notice/A2qsRhPmh5lGsDvTNo
* A bunch of intellectual types started following me on Twitter recently
* [[todo]] look into posting on [[gemini]]. Might be a good medium for a flavor of the agora?
* Been talking to my friend Grace about [[dmt]] and the nature of reality. We got stoned on her [[volcano]] the other night and listened to [[Terrance McKenna]] talks on YouTube
	* McKenna also put forward the idea that psychedelics were "doorways into the [Gaian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(mythology) "Gaia (mythology)") mind",[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#cite_note-NobleSavage-43)[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#cite_note-Trip1993-61) suggesting that "the planet has a kind of intelligence, it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being" and that the psychedelic plants were the facilitators of this communication.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#cite_note-62)
	* This is probably my new favorite theory
* TIL [[git]] comes with examples for git hooks in `.git/hooks` for every new repo you initialize
	* I'm testing creating a post-commit hook that copies over new notes to public repo and pushes them to [[gitlab]]
	* OMG it worked heh here it is `cat .git/hooks/post-commit`

```
#!/bin/sh
cd ../yolo-pub
rsync ../yolo/*.md .
git add .
git commit -m post-commit-hook
git push
```

-	It doesn't look like [[agora]] currently supports triple-tick format, I'm not sure the proper name for it
-	Started using [[hypothes.is]] to comment on nodes in the agora, I'm mostly just writing comments on flancians dailys
-	Was just checking out https://beepb00p.xyz/blog-graph.html interesting to see blog as a graph very [[roam-like]]
-	checking out [[dendron]] It's a [[vscode]] extension like [[foam]]
	-	An actual dendron is so simple in its structure yet so complex in its function. I love that

		-	Ontic structural realism refers to the novel, exciting, and widely discussed basic idea that the structure of physical reality is genuinely relational. In its radical form, the doctrine claims that there are, in fact, no objects but only structure, i.e., relations.
