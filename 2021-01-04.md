-	TIL you can use dashes for bullets, I've been using asterisks.
-	Pushed the agora browser extension to public repo
	-	https://gitlab.com/veracantcode/agora-ext
-	Tempted to move my private notes into another system, I'm kinda tired of managing two repos. Maybe obsidian can do that bit for me
	-	GitJournal only allows me one repo turns out
-	Thinking about if I want to start using a feed reader or if fedi is enough
-	TIL **Â¤** is unicode for "generic currency symbol" 

* Woke up later than I was meaning to.
* I wish there was a better [[roam-like]] for mobile. I'm using [[GitJournal]] and it's a little too limited.
	* [[todo]] look for alternatives again
* My msg on [[fedi]] got a bunch of likes
	* https://freethinkers.lgbt/notice/A2qsRhPmh5lGsDvTNo
* A bunch of intellectual types started following me on Twitter recently
* [[todo]] look into posting on [[gemini]]. Might be a good medium for a flavor of the agora?
* Been talking to my friend Grace about [[dmt]] and the nature of reality. We got stoned on her [[volcano]] the other night and listened to [[Terrance McKenna]] talks on YouTube
	* McKenna also put forward the idea that psychedelics were "doorways into the [Gaian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(mythology) "Gaia (mythology)") mind",[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#cite_note-NobleSavage-43)[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#cite_note-Trip1993-61) suggesting that "the planet has a kind of intelligence, it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being" and that the psychedelic plants were the facilitators of this communication.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#cite_note-62)
	* This is probably my new favorite theory
* TIL [[git]] comes with examples for git hooks in `.git/hooks` for every new repo you initialize
	* I'm testing creating a post-commit hook that copies over new notes to public repo and pushes them to [[gitlab]]
	* OMG it worked heh here it is `cat .git/hooks/post-commit`

```
#!/bin/sh
cd ../yolo-pub
rsync ../yolo/*.md .
git add .
git commit -m post-commit-hook
git push
```

-	It doesn't look like [[agora]] currently supports triple-tick format, I'm not sure the proper name for it
-
