- [ ] add https functionality
	- [ ] put paths to certs in config file in prod
		- [ ] /etc/letsencrypt/live/anagora.org/cert.pem
		- [ ] /etc/letsencrypt/live/anagora.org/privkey.pem
	- [ ] date issue because pages don't support the first character being a number
		- [ ] use [[agora prefix]] in meantime for now `agora-prefix`
