-	I went on a tangent now I'm exploring [[artwork in old books]]
	-	hopefully this doesn't mess up git since it's not good with large files, we'll see


 A cool way to discover new sites is to look at backlinks for [[go]] node

was trying to explain to my friend the other day how [[quantum decoherence]] is responsible for our observation of whether [[schrodinger's cat]] is dead(sleeping) or alive(awake)
-	I like the sleep/awake version better because it doesn't involve killing cats
-	the universe (specifically the observer) finds themselves in a world that the cat is awake/asleep. There are two observers (we are talking about [[many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics]] here). 
	-	In the [[copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics]], there is only one observer and the universe "collapses" to show us what's "really happening"
-	[[side note]] the TV shows [[devs]] is an interesting show that talks about quantum mechanics from a very mathematically sound perspective
